Fragments

group of children elements without adding extra nodes in the dom

In react when you want create an object you have to declare a global tag that can contain the other tags
example:
    return (<div><h1>Title</h1><p>Pargraph</p></div>)
However we dont always want to declare a div that adds to the dom, we dont want add more tags in the dom
so we include React.Fragments as a tag
    return (<React.Fragment><h1>Title</h1><p>Pargraph</p></React.Fragment>)
The global tag wont be rendered
    return (<><h1>Title</h1><p>Pargraph</p></>)
We also can use <> and </>
