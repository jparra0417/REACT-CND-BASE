Context API

App component has a tree components

root
A B C 
  D E
    F

Our requirement is that we have to pass the name from root to A D F

For A is easy because we can pass by props
but what about if we need to pass from root to F

>>> context provides a way to passs data trhough the component tree withut having to passs props down manually at every level

let's work with the sde C E F

we have the problem reating contexts that is very tedious

        import React from 'react'
        import { HookUserContext, ChannelContext } from './HookComponentC'


        export default function HookComponentF() {
            return (
                <div>
                    Component f
                    <HookUserContext.Consumer>
                        {
                            user => {
                                return (
                                    <ChannelContext.Consumer>
                                        {
                                            channel => {
                                                return <div>User cntext value {user}, {channel}</div>
                                            }
                                        }
                                    </ChannelContext.Consumer>
                                )
                            }

                        }
                    </HookUserContext.Consumer>
                </div>
            )
        }

So the solution is to use context hooks


            export default function HookComponentE() {

                const user = useContext(HookUserContext)
                const channel = useContext(ChannelContext)

                return (
                    <div>
                        {user} - {channel}
                        <HookComponentF></HookComponentF>
                    </div>
                )
            }
