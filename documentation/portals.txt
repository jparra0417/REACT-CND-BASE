By default React work with an element that its id is root
sometimes we need to have an element outside of the root
<div id="root"></div>
<div id="nuevo"></div>

this is very useful when we want elements agnostic to the application for example
modal, message, etc

so they need to be implemented in a different element

example:

    import React, { Component } from 'react'
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'


    export class PortalDemo extends Component {
        render() {
            return ReactDOM.createPortal(
                <div>
                    Portals demo
                </div>,
                document.getElementById("portal-root")
            )
        }
    }

    export default PortalDemo

In this case PortalDemo will be implemented on the div id = portal-root
