We have created components that extends components
there are components that can extend PureComponent

it means that when re render a component , the component always will re render because its method shouldComponentUpdate i always true
whereas pure component check a swallow comparison of the values that were changed
it means that verifies if the values has the same value and the same type for primitive types
and verify the same reference for the complex objects

it avoids re render components even when the values werenot changed and it helps to the performance of application

For Class components it should extend to React.PureComponent
    class PureC extends React.PureComponent{
        ...
    }

For function components
    function MemoComp(props) {
        ...
    }

    export default React.memo(MemoComp)
