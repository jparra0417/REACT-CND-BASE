we have 4 phases

Mounting -
    When an instance of a components is being created and inserted into the DOM

    Methods:
        -constructor 
            -> called whenever a new component is created
            -> Initializing state
            -> binding events
            -> called super(props)
            -> Directly overwrite this.state
            -> Do not cause side effects ex HTTP Requests
        -state getDerivedStateFromProps
            ->the state of components dependens on changes in props
            ->set the state
            ->Do not cause side effect: HTTP Requests
        -render
            -> Only required Methods
            -> Read props & state and return JSX
            -> Do not change state or interact with DOM or make ajax calls
            -> Children components lifecycle methods are also executed        
        -componentDidMount
            - invoked inmediayly after a componen and all its children components have been rendered
            - Cause side effects Ex:  Interact with the dom or perform any ajax calls to load data
            


Updating
    When a component is being re-rendered as a result of changes to either its props or state
     Methods:
        -state getDerivedStateFromProps
            -> receive the props and state as parameter
            -> called everytime a component is re rendered
            -> set the state
            -> Do not cause side effects example : HTTP
        -shouldComponentUpdate
            -> Dictates if the component should re render or not
            -> prevent default behavior
            -> performance optimization
            -> Do not cause side effects example : HTTP
        -render
            -> Only required methods
            -> read props 
            -> Do not cause side effects example : HTTP
        -getSnapshotBeforeUpdate
            -> paramteres prevProps, prevState
            -> Called right before the changes from the virtual are to be reflected
            -> Cature some information from the DOM
            -> return null or value , retured value will be passed as the third parameter to the next method
        -componentDidUpdate
            -> Called after the render is finished in the re-render cycles
            -> arguments
                -prevProps
                -prevState
                -snapshot
            -> Cause side effects




Unmounting
    When a component is being removed from the DOM

    Methods:
        -componentWillUnmount
            - Method invoked inmediatle before a component is umounted
            -Cancelling any network Requests
            

Error handling
    when there is an error during rendenring

    Meethods
        - getDerivedStateFromError
        - componentDidCatch
            - When there is an error it catches the error
